# freeCodeCamp - Salon Appointment Scheduler Project

This is one of the projects that requires implementation as part of [freeCodeCamp's Relational Database Certification](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/relational-database/).

As part of the [project's requirements](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/relational-database/build-a-salon-appointment-scheduler-project/build-a-salon-appointment-scheduler), this repository includes the following files:

- A salon.sql file that creates a PostgreSQL database with the data needed for passing the test.
- A salon.sh bash file for scheduling appointments for a list of available hair salon services and saving data into the database.
